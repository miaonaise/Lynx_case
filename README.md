# Lynx_case
Assignment for Junior quantative analyst position at Lynx 

## How to run the code
I wrote the code in Google Colab, so the fail proof way is to download the repisitory and upload it into your local Google Drive. Don't forget to update the current working directory in Section 0: Intial stuff in that case. 

Otherwise, I recommend running it in jupyter notebook. Remove the setting up Google Drive part, and install the packages that you need. 

## How to read the code
There are three notebooks:
- Spiff.ipynb: the main notebook divided into 10 sections
  - section 0:
- functions.ipynb: module with supporting analysis functions
- plotting.ipynb: module with supporting plotting functions
